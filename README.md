# Project: Maximizing Red Wine Profits with Regression Machine Learning Algorithms
 Predict the perfect ratio of ingredients for red wine. This is a numerical discrete outcome. 
 Explore with various Regression Models &amp; see which yields  greatest accuracy.
 Examine trends &amp; correlations within our data. 
 Determine which features are important in determing the quality of red wine. 
 Note: Due to the fact that we are predicting a numerical discreet value, we will be training various Regression Models.
